        <H3>My Experiences</H3>
        <p>I was lucky enough to be able to take my parents to Spain to celebrate my mom's birthday! I was absolutely enamoured by the country, especially Barcelona. I saw beautiful beaches, incredible architecture, and experienced a new culture. I would definitely visit again!</p>
        <H3>Attractions</H3>
        <p>There are endless beautiful places you can visit while in Spain. My top three recommendations would be:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>La Sagrada Familia Basilica
            <li>L'Arc de Triomf</li>
            <li>Mercado de la Boqueria</li>
            </ol>
        <H3>Travel Tips</H3>
            <p>When traveling in Spain or across Europe, I would recommend a few things. First, learn a bit of Spanish if you can and if you don't already know. Next, keep your belongings safe on you. A crossbody bag is recommended. Also, better to leave any valuables behind. Finally, if you are taking public transportation across the country, such as the rail system, including high-speed trains (AVE), be wary of scams or fake sites. I found it easier to purchase on-site and in-person. Here is a link to one of their official websites for one of the more economical options: <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en">Renfe | Train Tickets AVE</a></p>
