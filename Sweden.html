        <H3>My Experiences</H3>
        <p>I actually initially bought a ticket to visit Edinburgh, but ended up switching it when my dad informed me that he actually had a sister who lives in Sweden! It was such a nice experience to be able to meet my aunt and cousins for the first time and see my dad reunite with his sister after decades.</p>
        <H3>Attractions</H3>
        <p>I fell in love with the beautiful nature that Sweden has to offer. My top three recommendations would be:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Skrapan</li>
            <li>Old Towna</li>
            <li>Drottningolm Palace</li>
            </ol>
        <H3>Travel Tips</H3>
            <p>When traveling in Sweden or across Europe, I would recommend a few things. Of course, try to learn a bit of Swedish if you can. Although, much of the country speaks English as well. Luckily I had my aunt to help translate for us. Next, become familiar with the public transportation. This is how I got around everyday and while it wasn't the most complicated to use, there were some stops in the "Tunnelbana" the Swedish subway, that was quite busy. Generally when traveling, try to keep your belongings safe on you. A crossbody bag is recommended.</p>
