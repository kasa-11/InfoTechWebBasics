        <H3>My Experiences</H3>
        <p>I am half Nicaraguan and half Salvadorean, so some of my favorite memories growing up was visiting the homeland. Nothing compares to spending time with family over the Christmas festivities. I'm lucky to have had incredible food, culture, and music all these years.</p>
        <H3>Attractions</H3>
        <p>These tropical places have never ending beauty to see and experience. My top three recommendations would be:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Concepion De Ataco- El Salvador</li>
            <li>San Juan Del Sur- Nicaragua</li>
            <li>Corn Island- Nicaragua</li>
            </ol>
        <H3>Travel Tips</H3>
            <p>I would definitely recommend picking up a bit of Spanish if you don't already know it. Even just the basics can help you get around and have a smoother experience. For example, buses and ferries and popular ways people get around so asking for directions in Spanish can go far. I would advice having a travel buddy when moving around the country via public transportation.</p>
